# Task 1: Rule-Based System for Crossing the Street
This project demonstrates a rule-based system designed to determine whether it is safe to cross the street based on simple environmental inputs. The system uses basic decision-making logic to evaluate conditions.

### Features
- Uses rule-based decision-making to model a real-world scenario.
- Considers multiple factors to make a crossing decision.
- Demonstrates fundamental programming concepts, such as conditional statements and user input handling.

### Inputs
The system evaluates the following inputs:
1. **Traffic Light State:**
   - Options: `Red`, `Yellow`, or `Green`
2. **Crosswalk Signal:**
   - Options: `Walk` or `Don't Walk`
3. **Traffic Flow:**
   - Options: `Stopped`, `Heavy`, or `Light`

### Outputs
Based on the inputs, the system outputs:
- `Safe to Cross`
- `Do Not Cross`
- `Caution`

### Running the Program
- Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
- Open and run the program in a Jupyter Notebook.
- Provide the required inputs when prompted.
